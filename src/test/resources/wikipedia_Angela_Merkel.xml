                    Having earned a doctorate as a [[Physical chemistry|physical chemist]], Merkel entered politics in the wake of the [[Revolutions of 1989]], briefly serving as the deputy spokesperson for the first democratically elected [[East Germany|East German Government]] in 1990. Following the [[German reunification]] in 1990, she was elected to the [[Bundestag]] for [[Stralsund &#x2013; Nordvorpommern &#x2013; R&#xFC;gen (electoral district)|Stralsund-Nordvorpommern-R&#xFC;gen]] in the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], a seat she has held since. She was later appointed as the [[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth|Federal Minister for Women and Youth]] in 1991 under [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]], and became the [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety]] in 1994, serving until 1998. After the [[CDU/CSU]] coalition was defeated in 1998, she was elected [[General Secretary|Secretary-General]] of the CDU, before being elected the party's first ever woman as leader in 2000.
                    
                    Following the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 federal election]], she was appointed Germany's first female Chancellor at the head of a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] consisting of her own CDU party, its Bavarian sister party, the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). In the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 federal election]], the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote, and Merkel was able to form a coalition government with the support of the CSU, and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP).&lt;ref name="BBCnewterm2"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8329490.stm|title=Germany's Merkel begins new term|accessdate=1 November 2009|date=28 October 2009|publisher=BBC|archiveurl=

                    In 2007, Merkel was [[President of the European Council]] and chaired the [[G8]], the second woman (after [[Margaret Thatcher]]) to do so. She played a central role in the negotiation of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] and the [[Berlin Declaration (2007)|Berlin Declaration]]. One of her priorities was also to strengthen transatlantic economic relations by signing the agreement for the [[Transatlantic Economic Council]] on 30 April 2007.

Her mother was the daughter of the Danzig politician [[Willi Jentzsch]] and maternal granddaughter of the [[Clerk (municipal official)|city clerk]] of [[Elbing]] (now [[Elbl&#x105;g]], Poland) [[Emil Drange]].

                    Merkel's father was born a Catholic, but the Kasner family converted to Lutheranism after some years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/german-elections-blog-2013/2013/sep/10/angela-merkel-origins-germany-election|author=Stefan Kornelius |title=Six things you didn't know about Angela Merkel|newspaper=''The Guardian'' |date=9 September 2013|archivedate=10 September 2013|archiveurl=

In 1954 her father received a pastorate at the church in [[Quitzow]] (near [[Perleberg]] in [[Brandenburg]]), which then was in [[East Germany]], and the family moved to [[Templin]]. Thus Merkel grew up in the countryside {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[East Berlin]].
                    
                    Like most young people in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany), Merkel was a member of the [[Free German Youth|Free German Youth (FDJ)]], the official youth movement sponsored by the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]]. Although membership was nominally voluntary, those who didn't join found it all but impossible to be admitted to higher education. She did not take part in the secular [[coming of age]] ceremony [[Jugendweihe]], however, which was common in East Germany, and was [[Confirmation (sacrament)#Lutheran view|confirmed]] instead. Later, at the Academy of Sciences, she became a member of the FDJ district board and secretary for "[[Agitprop]]" (Agitation and Propaganda). Merkel claimed that she was secretary for culture. When Merkel's onetime FDJ district chairman contradicted her, she insisted that: "According to my memory, I was secretary for culture. But what do I know? I believe I won't know anything when I'm 80."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-67682698.html|title=Die Schl&#xE4;ferin|language= de|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=9 November 2009|accessdate=19 August 2011 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20100524192026/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-67682698.html|archivedate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel's progress in the compulsory Marxism-Leninism course was graded only ''gen&#xFC;gend'' (sufficient, passing grade) in 1983 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gl&#xE4;nzend in Physik, m&#xE4;&#xDF;ig in der Ideologie|url= http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,675061,00.html|language=de|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=31 January 2010|quote="Nach meiner Erinnerung war ich Kultursekret&#xE4;rin.

                    Merkel stood for election at the [[German federal election, 1990|1990 federal election]], the first since reunification, and was successfully elected to the [[Bundestag]] for the constituency of [[Stralsund &#x2013; Nordvorpommern &#x2013; R&#xFC;gen (electoral district)|Stralsund &#x2013; Nordvorpommern &#x2013; R&#xFC;gen]], which is in the [[Districts of Germany|district]] of [[Vorpommern-R&#xFC;gen]].

After her first election, she was almost immediately appointed to the [[Cabinet of Germany|Cabinet]], serving as [[Cabinet of Germany|Minister for Women and Youth]] under [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]]. In 1994, she was promoted to becoming [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Minister for the Environment and Nuclear Safety]], which gave her greater political visibility and a platform from which to build her political career. As one of Kohl's prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;es and his youngest Cabinet Minister, she was frequently referred to by Kohl as "''mein M&#xE4;dchen''" ("my girl").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=de|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=30 May 2005|url= http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,357997,00.html|title=Kohls untersch&#xE4;tztes M&#xE4;dchen|accessdate=19 August 2011|archiveurl=

                    ==Leader of the Opposition==
                    After the [[Helmut Kohl|Kohl Government]] was [[German federal election, 1998|defeated at the 1998 election]], Merkel was appointed Secretary-General of the CDU, a key position as the party was no longer part of the government. Merkel oversaw a string of CDU election victories in six out of seven state elections in 1999, breaking the long-standing SPD-Green hold on the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Following a [[1999 CDU contributions scandal|party funding scandal]] which compromised many leading figures of the CDU, including Kohl himself and his successor as CDU Leader, [[Wolfgang Sch&#xE4;uble]], Merkel criticised her former mentor publicly and advocated a fresh start for the party without him. She was subsequently elected to replace Sch&#xE4;uble, becoming the first female CDU Leader on 10 April 2000. Her election surprised many observers, as her personality offered a contrast to the party she had been elected to lead; Merkel is a [[Protestant]] originating from predominantly Protestant northern Germany, while the CDU is a male-dominated, [[social conservative|socially conservative]] party with strongholds in western and southern Germany, and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has deep Catholic roots.
                    
                    Following Merkel's election as CDU Leader, she enjoyed considerable popularity among the German population and polls indicated that many Germans would like to see her become [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Gerhard Schr&#xF6;der]]'s main challenger in the [[German federal election, 2002|2002 election]]. However she was subsequently outmanoeuvred politically by CSU Leader [[Edmund Stoiber]], to whom she eventually ceded the privilege of challenging Schr&#xF6;der. He went on to squander a large lead in opinion polls to lose the election by a razor-thin margin. After Stoiber's defeat in 2002, in addition to her role as CDU Leader, Merkel became Leader of the Opposition in the [[Bundestag]]; [[Friedrich Merz]], who had held the post prior to the 2002 election, was eased out to make way for Merkel.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}
                    
                    Merkel supported a substantial [[reform movement|reform]] agenda concerning Germany's economic and social system and was considered to be more pro-market than her own party (the CDU); she advocated changes to German labour law, specifically removing barriers to laying off employees and increasing the allowed number of work hours in a week, arguing that existing laws made the country less competitive because companies cannot easily control labour costs at times when business is slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,249207,00.html|title=Merkel fordert l&#xE4;ngere Arbeitszeit|language=de|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=18 May 2003|accessdate= 27 August 2011|archivedate=29 May 2003|archiveurl=

                    Merkel argued for Germany's [[nuclear power]] to be phased out less quickly than the Schr&#xF6;der administration had planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP_Merkel_Nuclear_phase_out_is_wrong_1006081.html|title=Merkel: Nuclear phase-out is wrong|newspaper=[[World Nuclear News]]|date=10 June 2008|accessdate=27 August 2011|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110616040957/http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP_Merkel_Nuclear_phase_out_is_wrong_1006081.html|archivedate=14 July 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    Merkel advocated a strong transatlantic partnership and German-American friendship. In the spring of 2003, defying strong public opposition, Merkel came out in favour of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. invasion of Iraq]], describing it as "unavoidable" and accusing Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr&#xF6;der]] of [[anti-Americanism]]. She criticised the government's support for the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]] and favoured a "[[privileged partnership]]" instead. In doing so, she reflected public opinion that grew more hostile toward Turkish membership of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Marlies Casier and Joost Jongerden, eds. ''Nationalisms and Politics in Turkey'' (2010) p 110&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    On 30 May 2005, Merkel won the CDU/CSU nomination as challenger to Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr&#xF6;der]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 national elections]]. Her party began the campaign with a 21 point lead over the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in national opinion polls, although her personal popularity lagged behind that of the incumbent. However, the CDU/CSU campaign suffered{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} when Merkel, having made economic competence central to the CDU's platform, confused [[gross income|gross]] and [[net income]] twice during a televised debate. She regained some momentum after she announced that she would appoint [[Paul Kirchhof]], a former judge at the German Constitutional Court and leading fiscal policy expert, as Minister of Finance.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}
                    
                    Merkel and the CDU lost ground after Kirchhof proposed the introduction of a [[flat tax]] in Germany, again undermining the party's broad appeal on economic affairs and convincing many voters that the CDU's platform of deregulation was designed to benefit only the rich. This was compounded by Merkel proposing to increase [[VAT]] to reduce Germany's deficit and fill the gap in revenue from a flat tax. The SPD were able to increase their support simply by pledging not to introduce flat taxes or increase VAT. Although Merkel's standing recovered after she distanced herself from Kirchhof's proposals, she remained considerably less popular than Schr&#xF6;der, and the CDU's lead was down to 9% on the eve of the election.
                    
                    On 18 September 2005, Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schr&#xF6;der's SPD went head-to-head in the national elections, with the CDU/CSU winning 35.3% (CDU 27.8%/CSU 7.5%) of the second votes to the SPD's 34.2%. Neither the SPD-Green coalition nor the CDU/CSU and its preferred coalition partners, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], held enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag, and both Schr&#xF6;der and Merkel claimed victory. A [[grand coalition]] between the CDU/CSU and SPD faced the challenge that both parties demanded the chancellorship. However, after three weeks of [[negotiation (process)|negotiations]], the two parties reached a deal whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=

                    Reports had indicated that the grand coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which differ from Merkel's political platform as leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. The coalition's intent was to cut public spending whilst increasing [[VAT]] (from 16 to 19%), [[social insurance]] contributions and the top rate of [[income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=German coalition poised for power|date=11 November 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4429518.stm|work=BBC News |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20091031061627/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4429518.stm|archivedate=25 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

                    On 22 November 2005, Merkel assumed the office of Chancellor of Germany following a [[German federal election, 2005|stalemate election]] that resulted in a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]. She was [[German federal election, 2009|re-elected in 2009]] with a larger majority and was able to form a governing coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]].

                    One of Merkel's priorities involved strengthening transatlantic economic relations - she signed the agreement for the Transatlantic Economic Council on 30 April 2007 at the White House.

                    Following [[Liquidity crisis of September 2008|major falls in worldwide stock markets in September 2008]], the German government stepped in to assist the [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] company [[Hypo Real Estate]] with a bailout which was agreed on October 6, with German banks to contribute &#x20AC;30 billion and the [[Deutsche Bundesbank|Bundesbank]] &#x20AC;20 billion to a credit line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=amxJTktF7JMs&amp;refer=home|title= Hypo Real Gets EU50 Billion Government-Led Bailout|last=Parkin|first=Brian|author2= Suess, Oliver|date=6 October 2008|newspaper=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=6 October 2008|archivedate=22 October 2012|archiveurl=

At the invitation of the Indian government, the two countries held their first intergovernmental consultations in New Delhi.

                    The Indian government presented the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding]] for the year 2009 to Merkel. A statement issued by the Government of India stated that the award "recognises her personal devotion and enormous efforts for sustainable and equitable development, for good governance and understanding and for the creation of a world better positioned to handle the emerging challenges of the 21st century."&lt;ref name=india/&gt;

                    ==Cabinets==
                    The [[Cabinet Merkel I|first cabinet of Angela Merkel]] was sworn in at 16:00 [[Central European Time|CET]], on 22 November 2005.
                    
                    On 31 October 2005, after the defeat of his favoured candidate for the position of Secretary General of the SPD, [[Franz M&#xFC;ntefering]] indicated that he would resign as Chairman of the party in November, which he did. Ostensibly responding to this, [[Edmund Stoiber]] (CSU), who was originally nominated for the Economics and Technology post, announced his withdrawal on 1 November 2005. While this was initially seen as a blow to Merkel's attempt at forming a viable coalition and cabinet, the manner in which Stoiber withdrew earned him much ridicule and severely undermined his position as a Merkel rival. Separate conferences of the CDU, CSU, and SPD approved the proposed Cabinet on 14 November 2005.
                    
                    The [[Second Merkel cabinet|second cabinet of Angela Merkel]] was sworn in on 28 October 2009.&lt;ref name=cabinet2009&gt;{{cite news|last=Penfold|first=Chuck|url=

                    In 2013, Merkel won one of the most decisive victories in German history, achieving the best result for the CDU/CSU since reunification and coming within five seats of the first absolute majority since 1957. However, with the FDP, its preferred coalition partner, failing to enter parliament for the first time since 1949, the CDU/CSU turned to the SPD to form the third [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] in postwar German history and the second under Merkel's leadership.
                    
                    The [[third Merkel cabinet|third cabinet of Angela Merkel]] was sworn in on 17 December 2013.
