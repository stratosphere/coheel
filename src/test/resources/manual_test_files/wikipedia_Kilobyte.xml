						{{Quantities of bytes}}
						The '''kilobyte''' is a multiple of the unit [[byte]] for [[Computer data storage|digital information]]. Although the [[International System of Units|SI prefix]] ''[[kilo-]]'' means 1000, the term ''kilobyte'' and symbol ''KB'' have historically been used to refer to either 1024 (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) bytes or 1000 (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bytes, dependent upon context, in the fields of [[computer science]] and [[information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kilobyte Kilobyte – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary].

						For example, when referring to [[Data rate units|data transfer rates]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-transferrate.htm Conversion of Data Transfer Rate Units]&lt;/ref&gt; and to disk storage space,&lt;ref&gt;1977 Disk/Trend Report  Rigid Disk Drives, published June 1977&lt;/ref&gt; "kilobyte" means 1000 (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bytes.  On the other hand, [[random-access memory]] capacity such as [[CPU cache]] measurements are always stated in multiples of 1024 (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) bytes, due to memory's binary addressing.

						In the [[ISO/IEC 80000|International System of Quantities]], the kilobyte (symbol '''kB''') is 1000 bytes.  The binary representation of 1024 bytes typically uses the symbol '''KB''', using an upper-case K.  Informally sometimes the ''B'' is dropped, making '''K''' generally understood as 1024 bytes; however, this usage is not standardized and may be found used arbitrarily. All existing recommendations prefer to use the uppercase letter ''B'' for byte, because ''b'' is used for the [[bit]].

						==Definitions==
						The unit kilobyte is commonly used to mean either 1000 or 1024 bytes. The value 1024 originated as compromise technical jargon for the byte [[SI prefix|multiples]] that needed to be expressed by powers of 2, but lacked a convenient name. As 1024 (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) approximates 1000 (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), roughly corresponding SI multiples were used for binary multiples. In 1998 the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) enacted standards for [[binary prefix]]es, specifying the use of kilobyte to strictly denote 1000 bytes and [[kibibyte]] to denote 1024 bytes. By 2007, the IEC Standard had been adopted by the [[IEEE]], [[EU]], and [[NIST]] and is now part of the [[IEC 80000-13|International System of Quantities]]. Nevertheless, the term kilobyte continues to be widely used with both of the following two meanings:

						* 1&amp;nbsp;kB = {{gaps|1000|bytes}} = 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bytes is the definition recommended by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC).&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html Prefixes for Binary Multiples] — The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is used in [[computer network|networking]] contexts and most [[storage media]], particularly [[hard drive]]s, [[Flash memory|Flash]]-based storage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://apac.sandisk.com/Products/Catalog(1349)-SanDisk_Extreme_Ducati_Edition_USB_Flash_Drive.aspx SanDisk USB Flash Drive] "Note: 1 megabyte (MB) = 1 million bytes; 1 gigabyte (GB) = 1 billion bytes."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DVD]]s, and is also consistent with the other uses of the [[SI prefix]] in computing, such as [[Hertz#Computing|CPU clock speeds]] or [[FLOPS|measures of performance]]. The [[Mac OS X]] 10.6 file manager is a notable example of this usage in software. Since [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Snow Leopard]], file sizes are reported in decimal units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2419 |title=How Mac OS X reports drive capacity |publisher=Apple Inc |date=2009-08-27 |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

						* 1&amp;nbsp;KB (or [[kibibyte|KiB]]) = {{gaps|1024|bytes}} = 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; bytes is the definition used by most vendors of memory devices and software when referring to amounts of [[computer memory]], such as [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Professional Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 |last1=Sharma |first1=Kapil |last2=Kabir |last2=Mohammed J. |last3=Norton |first3=Peter C.

The rest of the computer world, including the programmers who write Linux, thinks of a kilobyte as 1,024 bytes (2^10 bytes), a megabyte as 1,048,576 bytes (2^20), and a gigabyte as 1,073,741,824 bytes (2^30), which means that you're buying just a bit less than you might think.'' |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BuvNp1OLZRQC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=linux+byte+kilobyte+1024&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-QTcUYKTF6GmigLzuoHYDQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=linux%20byte%20kilobyte%201024&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the unambiguous IEC standard the unit for this amount of information is one [[kibibyte]] (KiB).

						In December 1998, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] addressed such multiple usages and definitions by creating unique binary prefixes to denote multiples of 1024, such as “[[kibibyte]] (KiB)”, which represents 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, or 1024, bytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html|title=Prefixes for binary multiples|author=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}} "In December 1998 the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) [...] approved as an IEC International Standard names and symbols for prefixes for binary multiples for use in the fields of data processing and data transmission."&lt;/ref&gt;
