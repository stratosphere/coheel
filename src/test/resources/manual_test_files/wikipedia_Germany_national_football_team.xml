                    The '''Germany national football team''' ({{lang-de|Die deutsche Fu&#xDF;ballnationalmannschaft}}) is the [[Association football|football]] team that has represented [[Germany]] in international competition since 1908.&lt;ref name="First game" /&gt; It is governed by the [[German Football Association]] (''Deutscher Fu&#xDF;ball-Bund''), founded in 1900.&lt;ref name="GermanyFIFA"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fifa.com/associations/association=ger/index.html |title = Germany |publisher = FIFA |accessdate =14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ger/profile/index.html |title = Germany's strength in numbers |publisher = UEFA |accessdate =14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the DFB was reinaugurated in 1949 the team has represented the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] &#x2013; until the [[German reunification]] in 1990 commonly referred to as [[West Germany]] in informal usage. Under [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Allied occupation and division]], two other separate national teams were also recognized by [[FIFA]]: the [[Saarland national football team|Saarland team]] (1950&#x2013;1956) and the [[East Germany national football team|East German team]] representing the [[German Democratic Republic]] (1952&#x2013;1990).

The official name and code "Germany FR (FRG)" was shortened to "Germany (GER)" following the reunification in 1990.
                    
                    Germany is one of the most successful national teams in international competitions, having won a total of three [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] ([[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]], [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]]) and three [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championships]] ([[UEFA Euro 1972|1972]], [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]], [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]]).&lt;ref name="GermanyFIFA" /&gt; They have also been runners-up three times in the European Championships, four times in the World Cup, and have won a further four third places.&lt;ref name="GermanyFIFA" /&gt; East Germany won [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] Gold in [[Football at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197121/index.html |title=Olympic Football Tournament Montreal 1976 |publisher = FIFA |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany is the only nation to have won both [[FIFA World Cup|the men's]] and [[FIFA Women's World Cup|women's World Cups]].

                    ==Nicknames==
                    In Germany, the team is typically simply referred to as the ''Nationalmannschaft'' (national team), ''DFB-Elf'' (DFB eleven), ''DFB-Auswahl'' (DFB selection) or ''Nationalelf'' (national eleven). Whereas in foreign media, they are regularly described as ''(Die) Mannschaft'' (literally meaning "The Team"). The expression ''Die Adler'' (The Eagles) is also used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heimatsport.de/hintergrund/vermischtes/1106643_Ganz-in-Weiss-Die-Adler-tragen-ihre-neuen-Kleider.html heimatsport.de] &#x2013; ''Ganz in Wei&#xDF;: Die Adler tragen ihre neuen Kleider''&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    ==History==
                    ===Early years===
                    Between 1899 and 1901, prior to the formation of a national team, there were five unofficial international matches between different German and English selection teams, which all ended as large defeats for the German teams. Eight years after the establishment of the [[German Football Association]] (DFB), the first official match of the Germany national football team&lt;ref&gt;In early times it was simply called ''"die 11 besten Spieler von Deutschland"'' or just ''"die Bundesauswahl" (the Federation XI)''. Tags like ''"National team"'' or ''"National XI"'' weren't introduced until after World War I&lt;/ref&gt; was played on 5 April 1908, against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in [[Basel]], with the Swiss winning 5&#x2013;3.&lt;ref name="First game" /&gt; Coincidentally, the first match after [[World War I]] in 1920, the first match after [[World War II]] in 1950 when Germany was still banned from most international competitions, and the first match in 1990 with former East German players were all against Switzerland as well. Germany's first championship title was even won in Switzerland.
                    
                    At that time the players were selected by the DFB, as there was no dedicated coach. The first manager of the Germany national team was [[Otto Nerz]], a school teacher from [[Mannheim]], who served in the role from 1926 to 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=12339 |title=Professor Otto Nerz |work=DFB |accessdate=13 March 2012 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German FA could not afford travel to Uruguay for the first World Cup staged in 1930 during [[the Great Depression]], but finished third in the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934 World Cup]] in their first appearance in the competition. After a poor showing at the [[Football at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympic Games]] in Berlin, [[Sepp Herberger]] became coach. In 1937 he put together a squad which was soon nicknamed the ''Breslau Elf'' ([[Breslau Eleven|the Breslau Eleven]]) in recognition of their 8&#x2013;0 win over Denmark in the then German city of [[Breslau]], [[Lower Silesia]] (now Wroc&#x142;aw, Poland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welt.de/sport/article876494/Nur_Hitler_konnte_sie_stoppen.html |title=Nur Hitler konnte sie stoppen |language=German |date=16 May 2007 |first=Udo |last=Muras |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=500395&amp;action=showMatchesByYear&amp;lang=E&amp;liga=Nationalmannschaft&amp;year=1937&amp;cHash=0435f38e6e |title=All matches of The National Team in 1937 |publisher=DFB |accessdate=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    After Austria became part of Germany in the ''[[Anschluss]]'' of March 1938, that country's [[Austria national football team|national team]] &#x2013; one of Europe's better sides at the time due to professionalism &#x2013; was disbanded despite having already qualified for the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]]. As required by [[Nazi]] politicians, five or six ex-Austrian players, from the clubs [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Vienna]], [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Vienna]], [[First Vienna FC]], were ordered to join the all-German team on short notice in a staged show of unity orchestrated for political reasons. In the 1938 World Cup that began on 4 June, this "united" German team managed only a 1&#x2013;1 draw against Switzerland, and then lost the replay 2&#x2013;4 in front of a hostile crowd in Paris, France. That early exit stands as Germany's worst ever World Cup result (excluding the 1930 and 1950 tournaments in which they did not compete).
                    
                    During World War II, the team played over 30 international games between September 1939 and November 1942, when national team games were suspended, as most players had to join the armed forces. Many of the national team players were gathered together under coach Herberger as ''Rote J&#xE4;ger'' through the efforts of a sympathetic air force officer trying to protect the footballers from the most dangerous wartime service.
                    
                    ===Three German teams===
                    After the [[Second World War]], Germany was banned from competition in most sports until about 1950, with none of the three new German states, [[West Germany]], [[East Germany]] and [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]], entering the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] qualifiers, since the DFB was only reinstated as full FIFA member after this World Cup.
                    
                    ====West Germany====
                    As in most aspects of life, the pre-war traditions and organisations of Germany were carried on by the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], which was referred to as [[West Germany]]. This applied also to the restored DFB which had its headquarters in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]] and still employed coach [[Sepp Herberger]]. With recognition by [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]], the DFB maintained and continued the record of the pre-war team. Neighbouring [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] was once again the first team that played West Germany in 1950, with [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] and [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] being the only non-[[German language|German speaking]] nations to play them in friendly matches during 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rsssf.com/tablesd/duit-intres.html |title = (West) Germany &#x2013; International Results |publisher = RSSSF |accessdate =1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    After only 18 post war games in total, West Germany qualified for the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]], having prevailed against Norway and the "third German state", the Saarland.
                    
                    ====Saarland====
                    {{Main|Saarland national football team}}
                    The [[Saar (protectorate)|Saar protectorate]], otherwise known as Saarland, was split from Germany and put under French control between 1947 and 1956. Saarland did not want to join French organisations and was barred from participating in pan-German ones. Thus, they sent separate teams to the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] and also to the [[1954 FIFA World Cup qualification|1954 World Cup qualifiers]], when [[Saarland national football team|Saarland]] finished below West Germany but above [[Norway national football team|Norway]] in their qualification group, having won in Oslo. Legendary coach [[Helmut Sch&#xF6;n]] was the manager of the Saarland team from 1952 until 1957, when the territory acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany. He went on to coach the championship-winning team of the 1970s.
                    
                    ====East Germany====
                    {{Main|East Germany national football team}}
                    In 1949, the communist [[German Democratic Republic]] was founded in the [[Allied-occupied Germany|Soviet-occupied]] eastern part of the country. A separate football competition emerged in what was commonly known as East Germany. In 1952 the [[Deutscher Fu&#xDF;ball-Verband der DDR]] (DFV) was established and the [[East Germany national football team]] took to the field. They were the only team to beat the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup winning]] West Germans in a highly symbolic event for the divided nation that was the only meeting of the two sides. East Germany went on to win the gold medal at the [[Football at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]]. After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and [[German reunification]] in 1990, the eastern football competition was reintegrated into the DFB.

                    [[File:Rahndenkmal.JPG|thumb|right|A statue of [[Helmut Rahn]], who scored the winning goal in the 1954 FIFA World Cup final]]
                    West Germany, captained by [[Fritz Walter]], met in the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] some of the teams they had played in friendly matches, namely [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. When playing favourites [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in the group stage, with good chances to qualify for the next round even in case of defeat, coach [[Sepp Herberger]] did not field his best players, saving them from the experience of a 3&#x2013;8 loss. West Germany would go on to meet Hungary again in the final, facing the legendary team of [[Golden Team|Mighty Magyars]] again, which had gone unbeaten for 32 consecutive matches. In a shocking upset, West Germany came back from an early two goal deficit to win 3&#x2013;2, with [[Helmut Rahn]] scoring the winning goal with only six minutes remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,1486164,00.html |title=World Cup Final, 1954: Hungary vs. West Germany |work=The Making of a World Cup Legend |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=1 April 2010 |author=Nick Amies |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success is called "The Miracle of Bern" (''Das Wunder von Bern'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=1278/index.html |title=The Miracle of Bern |publisher = FIFA |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected victory created a sense of euphoria throughout a divided postwar Germany. The triumph is credited with playing a significant role in securing the postwar ideological foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany.
                    
                    ===Memorable losses: Wembley goal and Game of the Century===
                    After finishing fourth in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] and reaching only the quarter-finals in the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]], the DFB had to make changes. Following examples set abroad, professionalism was introduced, and the best clubs from the various Regionalligas were assembled into the new [[Fu&#xDF;ball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]]. In 1964, [[Helmut Sch&#xF6;n]] took over as coach, replacing Herberger who had been in office for 28 years.
                    
                    In the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], West Germany reached the final after beating the [[USSR national football team|USSR]] in the semifinal, facing hosts [[England national football team|England]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. [[Wolfgang Weber]]'s last minute goal took the game into [[extra time]], a goal claimed to be controversial by the English, with the ball appearing to hit the hand of a German player as it travelled through the England [[penalty area]] before he prodded it in. The first extra time goal by [[Geoff Hurst]], nicknamed ''[[:de:Wembley-Tor|Wembley-Tor]]'' (Wembley goal) in Germany, is still controversial after all this time. As the Swiss referee did not see the situation properly, the opinion of the Soviet linesman [[Tofik Bakhramov]] who believed that the ball bounced back from the net rather than the crossbar led to one of the most contentious goals in the history of football. While the Germans pushed hard to tie the game, spectators entered the field in the final seconds, and Hurst scored another controversial goal giving England a 4&#x2013;2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,1486167,00.html |title=World Cup Final, 1966: England vs. West Germany |work=The Making of a World Cup Legend |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=1 April 2010 |author=Nick Amies |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=1633/index.html |title=England&#x2019;s claim to the firmament |publisher = FIFA |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    West Germany gained a measure of revenge in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] by knocking England out in the quarter-finals 3&#x2013;2, having been 2&#x2013;0 down, before they suffered another memorable extra time loss, this time in the semi-final against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] at [[Estadio Azteca]]. [[Karl-Heinz Schnellinger]] scored during injury time to level the match at 1&#x2013;1, and during extra time, both teams held the lead at one time. Memorably, [[Franz Beckenbauer]] remained on the field even with a dislocated shoulder, his arm in a sling strapped to his body, as West Germany had used up their two allowed substitutions. Eventually won 4&#x2013;3 by Italy, this match with five goals in extra time is one of the most dramatic in World Cup history, and is called "[[Game of the Century (football)|Game of the Century]]" in both Italy (''Partita del secolo'') and Germany (''Jahrhundertspiel'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,1486172,00.html |title=World Cup Semi-Final, 1970: Italy vs. West Germany |work=The Making of a World Cup Legend |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=1 April 2010 |author=Nick Amies |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=1838/index.html |title=A test of endurance and will |publisher = FIFA |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the exhausted Italians {{According to whom|date=June 2013}} lost to Brazil, West Germany went on to claim third place by beating [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] 1&#x2013;0, and [[Gerd M&#xFC;ller]] finished as the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Boot|tournament's top scorer]] with 10 goals.

                    In 1971, [[Franz Beckenbauer]] became captain of the national team, and he led West Germany to great success as they became both the European and World Champions. They won the European Championship on their first try at [[UEFA Euro 1972|Euro 1972]], defeating the Soviet Union 3&#x2013;0 in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1972/matches/round=186/match=3838/postmatch/report/index.html |title=M&#xFC;ller the menace in German masterclass |publisher = [[UEFA]] |date=3 October 2003 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1972/overview/index.html |title=West Germany make their mark |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, as hosts of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]], they won their second World Cup, defeating the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 2&#x2013;1 in the final at the [[Olympic Stadium, Munich|Olympiastadion in Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=39/overview.html |title=1974 FIFA World Cup Germany &#x2013; Dutch take plaudits but Germany take the prize |publisher = FIFA |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    Two matches in the 1974 World Cup stood out for West Germany. The first group stage saw a politically charged match as West Germany played a game against [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]]. Both teams already were qualified for advance to the next round, and the East Germans won 1&#x2013;0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=2062/index.html |title=East edge battle of brothers |publisher = FIFA |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Germans adjusted their line up after the loss and advanced to the final which was the other outstanding match, against the [[Johan Cruijff]]-led Dutch team and their brand of "[[Total Football]]". Cruijff was brought down early in the German [[Penalty area (football)|penalty area]] following a solo run before any of the German players had even touched the ball, and the Dutch took the lead from the ensuing [[penalty kick (football)|penalty]] with just a minute gone on the clock. However, West Germany managed to come back, tying the match on a penalty scored by [[Paul Breitner]], and winning it with [[Gerd M&#xFC;ller]]'s goal just before half-time. A second goal by M&#xFC;ller was ruled offside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,2144,1486199,00.html |title=World Cup Final, 1974: West Germany vs. The Netherlands |work=The Making of a World Cup Legend |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=1 April 2010 |author=Nick Amies |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=2063/index.html |title=Oranje crushed in Munich |publisher = FIFA |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    ===Late 1970s and early 1980s===
                    West Germany failed to defend their titles in the next two major international tournaments. They lost to [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] in the final of [[UEFA Euro 1976|Euro 1976]] in a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] by a score of 5&#x2013;3 after the match finished 2&#x2013;2, with [[Uli Hoene&#xDF;]] famously kicking the ball sky high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1976/matches/round=193/match=3693/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Panenka's panache seals Czech triumph |publisher = [[UEFA]] |date=3 October 2003 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that loss, Germany has not lost a penalty shootout in major international tournaments. In fact, until [[Lukas Podolski]]'s shot was saved by the Serbian goalkeeper [[Vladimir Stojkovi&#x107;]] during group play of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], the last penalty missed by a German player dates back to the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] semifinals when the French goalkeeper [[Jean-Luc Ettori]] saved [[Uli Stielike]]'s shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/germany/7837934/World-Cup-2010-Lukas-Podolski-gains-entry-to-elite-club.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |title=World Cup 2010: Lukas Podolski's missed penalty sees him join elite Germany club |first=John |last=Ley |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=8 March 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    In the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]], Germany was eliminated in the second group stage after losing 2&#x2013;3 to [[Austria national football team|Austria]], who had already been eliminated from the round of 16. Sch&#xF6;n retired as coach afterward, and the post was taken over by his assistant, [[Jupp Derwall]].
                    
                    West Germany's first tournament under Derwall was successful, as they earned their second European title at [[UEFA Euro 1980|Euro 1980]] after defeating [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] 2&#x2013;1 in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1980/matches/round=198/match=3585/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Hrubesch turns West Germany's unlikely hero |publisher = [[UEFA]] |date=4 October 2003 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Germany then reached the final of the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]], though not without difficulties. They were upset 1&#x2013;2 by [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in their first match,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=741/index.html |title=Les Fennecs spring a surprise |publisher = FIFA |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but managed to advance to the second round with a [[West Germany v Austria (1982)|controversial 1&#x2013;0 win]] over [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. Then, in the semifinal against [[France national football team|France]], they came back from down 1&#x2013;3 during extra time to tie the match 3&#x2013;3 and won the following penalty shootout 5&#x2013;4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,1486213,00.html |title=World Cup Semi-Final, 1982: West Germany vs. France |work=The Making of a World Cup Legend |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=1 April 2010 |author=Nick Amies |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=914/index.html |title=Battling Germans knock out brave Bleus |publisher = FIFA |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final, they were defeated by Italy 1&#x2013;3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=923/index.html |title=Italians triumph in heavyweight rumble |publisher = FIFA |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    During this period, West Germany also had one of the world's most productive goal scorers in [[Gerd M&#xFC;ller]], who racked up fourteen goals in two World Cups (1970 and 1974). His ten goals in 1970 are the third-most ever in a tournament, behind France's [[Just Fontaine]] and Hungarian [[S&#xE1;ndor Kocsis]]. Though M&#xFC;ller's all-time World Cup record of 14 goals was broken by [[Ronaldo]] in 2006, it took Ronaldo three tournaments to do so (1998, 2002, and 2006). Germany's [[Miroslav Klose]] is in third place all-time, with fourteen goals, scored over three tournaments (2002, 2006, and 2010).&lt;ref name="FIFA World Cup Record - Players"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/tournaments/worldcup/players/index.html |title=FIFA World Cup Record &#x2013; Players |publisher = FIFA |accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Cup All-Time Top Goal Scorers"&gt;{{cite web |title=World Cup All-Time Top Goal Scorers |url=http://soccerlens.com/world-cup-all-time-top-goal-scorers/43909/ |publisher=Soccerlens |accessdate=14 January 2012 |author= Eddie Griffin |date= 20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="German World Cup top scorers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=311394 |title=German World Cup top scorers |publisher =DFB |accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronaldo's riposte"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/brazil/5112982.stm |title=Ronaldo's riposte |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 June 2006 |last=Chowdhury |first=Saj |accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

                    After West Germany were unexpectedly eliminated in the first round of [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro 1984]], [[Franz Beckenbauer]] returned to the national team to replace Derwall as coach.&lt;ref name="BeckenbauerFIFA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=25113/bio.html |work=FIFA |accessdate=1 February 2012 |title=Franz Beckenbauer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]], West Germany finished as runners-up for the second consecutive tournament after again beating France 2&#x2013;0 in the semi-finals but losing to the [[Diego Maradona]]-led [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the final, 2&#x2013;3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=68/overview.html |title=1986 FIFA World Cup Mexico &#x2013; Maradona lights up the world &#x2013; with a helping hand |work=FIFA |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=68/results/index.html |title=1986 FIFA World Cup Mexico &#x2013; Matches |work=FIFA |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[UEFA Euro 1988|Euro 1988]], West Germany's hopes of winning the tournament on home soil were spoiled by the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], as the Dutch gained revenge of their loss in 1974 by beating them 2&#x2013;1 in the semifinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1988/overview/index.html |work=UEFA |title=Van Basten sparks Netherlands joy |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    In the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]], West Germany finally won their third World Cup title in its unprecedented third consecutive final appearance.&lt;ref name="WC1990-Overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=76/overview.html |title=1990 FIFA World Cup Italy &#x2013; Germany hit winning note as Italian chorus fades |work=FIFA |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captained by [[Lothar Matth&#xE4;us]], they defeated [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] (4&#x2013;1), [[United Arab Emirates national football team|UAE]] (5&#x2013;1), the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] (2&#x2013;1), [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] (1&#x2013;0), and [[England national football team|England]] (1&#x2013;1, 4&#x2013;3 on penalty kicks) on the way to a final rematch against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=159/index.html |title=Gazza weeps as Germans prevail |publisher = FIFA |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=76/results/index.html |title=1990 FIFA World Cup Italy &#x2013; Matches |work=FIFA |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Germany won 1&#x2013;0, with the only goal being a penalty scored in the 85th minute by [[Andreas Brehme]].&lt;ref name="WC1990-Overview" /&gt; Beckenbauer, who won the World Cup as the national team's captain in 1974, thus became the second person ever (preceded only by [[M&#xE1;rio Zagallo]]) to win the World Cup as both player and coach, and the first as both captain and coach.&lt;ref name="BeckenbauerFIFA" /&gt;

                    Prior to 1984, Olympic football was an amateur event, meaning that only non-professional players could participate. Due to this, West Germany was never able to achieve the same degree of success at the Olympics as at the World Cup, with the only medal coming in the [[Football at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]], when they won the bronze medal. Since then, however, no German team has managed to qualify for the Olympics, even after the change of rules to include professionals, among them three athletes over 23 years old. West Germany also reached the second round in both [[Football at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]]. On the other hand, East Germany did far better, winning a gold, a silver and two bronze medals (one representing the [[United Team of Germany]]).

                    In February 1990, months after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], the draw for the [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying|1992 European Championship qualifying tournament]] saw [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]] and West Germany drawn together in [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 5|Group 5]]. After West Germany's 1990 World Cup win, with assistant [[Berti Vogts]] taking over as the national team coach, the retiring Beckenbauer infamously predicted that the German team, with additional former East Germans to choose from, would be invincible for years to come. The [[reunification of Germany]] was confirmed in August to take effect on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the former GDR to the Federal Republic of Germany. The members of the East German association [[Deutscher Fu&#xDF;ball-Verband]] acceded to the DFB in November, while the 1990&#x2013;91 seasons would continue, with the restructuring of leagues scheduled for 1991&#x2013;92. The first game with a unified German team, including former East German internationals such as [[Matthias Sammer]] and [[Ulf Kirsten]], was against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] on 19 December.

                    Following another early World Cup exit in 1998 along with the retirement of many key players and discouraging results under Ribbeck, Germany's standing as one of the world's elite national sides was in question.
                    
                    In [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], the aging team went out in the first round after failing to win any of their three matches, including an embarrassing 0&#x2013;3 loss to an understrength [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] side (who had already advanced to the next round).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/797033.stm |title=Holders Germany suffer heavy defeat |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=11 March 2012 |date=20 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ribbeck resigned amid strong public criticism and was replaced temporarily and then permanently by [[Rudi V&#xF6;ller]] &#x2013; after planned successor [[Christoph Daum]] was involved in a drug scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/germany/799959.stm |title=Ribbeck quits as Germans head home |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=11 March 2012 |date=21 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/germany/816163.stm |title=Voller named as caretaker coach |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=11 March 2012 |date=2 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Daum: I took cocaine |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/1114006.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=12 January 2001 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    Coming into the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], expectations of the German team were low due to poor results in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifiers]]. This included not directly qualifying for the finals for the first time. The team nonetheless dealt a thrashing to [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] 8&#x2013;0 in their first match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/germany_v_saudi_arabia/default.stm |title=Germany savage Saudis |date=1 June 2002 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the knockout stages, riding on the heroics of [[Oliver Kahn]] and [[Michael Ballack]] they produced three consecutive 1&#x2013;0 wins against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/germany_v_paraguay/default.stm |title=Germany edge out Paraguay |date=15 June 2002 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/germany_v_usa/default.stm |title=Germany beat valiant USA |date=22 June 2002 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-hosts [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/germany_v_south_korea/default.stm |title=Germany shatter Korea |date=25 June 2002 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting up a final against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], the first World Cup meeting between the two. Unfortunately Ballack was suspended for the final due to accumulated [[Misconduct (football)|yellow card]]s and Kahn was injured during the final proper. In a hard-fought match, Germany thus lost 0&#x2013;2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/germany_v_brazil/default.stm |title=Brazil crowned world champions |date=30 June 2002 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[Miroslav Klose]] won the [[Football World Cup awards#Golden Boot|Silver Boot]] and German captain and goalkeeper [[Oliver Kahn]] won the [[Football World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/germany/newsid_2081000/2081522.stm |title=Kahn wins Golden Ball award |date=2 July 2002 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first time in the World Cup's history that a goalkeeper was named the best player of the tournament, as well as the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Glove|Yashin-Award]] for the best goalkeeper in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/germany/newsid_2075000/2075695.stm |title=Kahn named top keeper |date=30 June 2002 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    Germany failed to build on their success in 2002 and again exited in the first round of [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]], this time drawing their first two matches and losing the third. As was the case in 2000, the team exited losing to an understrength side that had already advanced, in this case the [[Czech national football team|Czech Republic]]. Even though Germany dominated the match, they could not score, losing to a Czech goal scored on the break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/3787551.stm |title=Germany 1&#x2013;2 Czech Rep |date=23 June 2004 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; V&#xF6;ller resigned afterwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/germany/3834751.stm | title = Voeller quits Germany role | date = 24 June 2004 | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | accessdate =14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; denouncing the constant media criticism in a famous TV interview.

Klinsmann made [[Michael Ballack]] the captain following [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]]. Klinsmann's main task was to lead the national team to a good showing at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] being hosted in Germany.
                    
                    Prior to the start of the tournament, hopes were not as high for Germany as in previous tournaments (even in Germany itself), even though it was the host nation. Critics pointed out the apparent lack of quality players in the squad and coach Klinsmann's decision to live in America rather than Germany. However, Germany won the opening game of the World Cup against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] 4&#x2013;2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4852498.stm |title=Germany 4&#x2013;2 Costa Rica |date=9 June 2006 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continued to develop both confidence and support across the group stage, conceding no further goals as they beat Poland 1&#x2013;0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4852960.stm |title=Germany 1&#x2013;0 Poland |date=14 June 2006 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ecuador 3&#x2013;0, with [[Miroslav Klose]] scoring twice and [[Lukas Podolski]] adding another in the last match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4853270.stm |title=Ecuador 0&#x2013;3 Germany |date=20 June 2006 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany finished on top of their group with three wins. The team went on to defeat [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] 2&#x2013;0 in the round of 16, with [[Lukas Podolski]] netting both goals in only 12 minutes, from assists by [[Miroslav Klose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991466.stm |title=Germany 2&#x2013;0 Sweden |date=24 June 2006 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

                    Germany faced favorites Argentina in the quarter-finals, a team that Germany had not defeated since the 1990 World Cup. Germany's clean sheet streak was broken shortly after half time as Argentina scored first to grab a 0&#x2013;1 lead. However, [[Michael Ballack]]'s cross, flicked on by [[Tim Borowski]], allowed Klose to head in the equalizer with 10 minutes to spare. During the subsequent penalty shootout, goalkeeper [[Jens Lehmann]] saved two shots while his teammates all converted their shots to win the shootout 4&#x2013;2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991602.stm |title=Germany 1&#x2013;1 Argentina |date=30 June 2006 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Lehmann had penalty taker notes |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/germany/5136802.stm |date = 1 July 2006|work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/jul/01/worldcup2006.match1 |first=Michael |last=Walker |title=Lehmann's penalty heroics send Germany into raptures |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=1 July 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2012 |location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the game, the Argentinians started a brawl, which later resulted in a match ban for midfielder [[Torsten Frings]] after Italian television networks showed video footage of him participating in the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/news/newsid=16350.html |title=Frings missing but Germany remain confident |work=FIFA |date=4 July 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    Expectations rose in Germany following these results, with many thinking that a record eighth appearance in the World Cup final was possible even though a starter was missing and the players were tired after already playing a tough 120 minutes against Argentina. In the semifinal match against Italy, the match went to extra time again, and hopes grew high that another penalty shootout would take the team to the final match in Berlin. However, despite Klinsmann's focus on fitness, the speed and concentration of the German players faded, and they conceded two goals in the final ninety seconds of [[extra time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991640.stm |title=Germany 0&#x2013;2 Italy (aet) |date=4 July 2006 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    Despite having their dreams of playing in the final dashed, Klinsmann's squad quickly recovered their composure, and journalists noted the team's upbeat mood in the practices leading up to the third-place match. Three starters, including captain Michael Ballack, would not be available for the third place match, and their opponent Portugal's goalkeeper, [[Ricardo Pereira|Ricardo]], had up to that point conceded only one goal in regular play. Nonetheless, Germany thoroughly defeated Portugal 3&#x2013;1, at one point leading 3&#x2013;0 due to [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]]'s two goals and an own goal, also off his shot, by Portugal's [[Armando Teixeira|Petit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991644.stm |title=Germany 3&#x2013;1 Portugal |date=8 July 2006 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    With this victory, Germany ended the World Cup on a high, not only with the 3&#x2013;1 win over Portugal in the battle for third place, but also with several awards: [[Miroslav Klose]] was awarded the [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] for his tournament-leading five goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/germany/5163768.stm | title = Klose finishes as leading scorer | date = 9 July 2006 | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | accessdate =14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first player from the united Germany to earn it, and fellow striker [[Lukas Podolski]] won the 'Best Young Player' award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/5157434.stm | title = Podolski beats Ronaldo to award | date = 7 July 2006 | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | accessdate =14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, four of Germany's players ([[Jens Lehmann]], [[Philipp Lahm]], [[Michael Ballack]], and [[Miroslav Klose]]) were selected for the tournament All-Star Team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/news/newsid=31923.html |title=Azzurri prominent in All Star Team |work=FIFA |date=7 July 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, with 14 goals scored, the German side scored more goals than any other team in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/statistics/index.html |title=Germany 2006 &#x2013; Statistics |publisher = [[FIFA]] |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the tournament, over 500,000 people honored the team by giving them a hero's welcome at the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in [[Berlin]].

                    Germany's entry into the [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group D|Euro 2008 qualifying round]] was marked partially by the promotion of [[Joachim L&#xF6;w]] to head coach, since Klinsmann retired in spite of a public outcry for him to continue managing the Mannschaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/germany/5171242.stm | title = Klinsmann quits as Germany coach | date = 12 July 2006 | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | accessdate =14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/jul/12/newsstory.sport13?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=Klinsmann quits, Low steps in |publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=12 July 2006 |accessdate=14 February 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; L&#xF6;w did not have the sweeping charisma of his predecessor, but the reputation of being a shrewd and capable tactician. He quickly became notable for continually introducing talented young players into his team, leading to a continuous rejuvenation of the squad. In a group with the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], Germany qualified comfortably, defeating [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] in a record 13&#x2013;0 away win along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2008/matches/round=2241/match=83623/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Records tumble as Germany soar |work=UEFA.com |date=6 September 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    For the [[UEFA Euro 2008|final tournament]], Germany were placed into [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group B|Group B]] alongside [[Poland national football team|Poland]], [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] and longtime rivals [[Austria national football team|Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Draw sets up heavyweight contests |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=631046.html |publisher=UEFA |date=3 December 2007 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany defeated Poland 2&#x2013;0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2008/7363058.stm |title=Germany 2&#x2013;0 Poland |date=8 June 2008 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012 |first=Phil |last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; but suffered an ignominious 1&#x2013;2 defeat to Croatia, compounded by a red card for [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] for an aggressive off-the-ball incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2008/7363074.stm |title=Croatia 2&#x2013;1 Germany |date=12 June 2008 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012 |first=Chris |last=Bevan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany entered the knockout round with a victory over Austria in the last match of group play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2008/7363084.stm |title=Austria 0&#x2013;1 Germany &amp; Poland 0&#x2013;1 Croatia |date=16 June 2008 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012 |first=Saj |last=Chowdhury}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only scorer of the game was [[Michael Ballack]], who scored in the 49th minute with a powerful long-distance free-kick that was later chosen as the [[Goal of the Year (Germany)|German Goal of the Year]]. Their quarterfinal opponent was [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]. Germany started well and took an early lead after Schweinsteiger converted a cross from [[Lukas Podolski]]. [[Miroslav Klose]] made it 2&#x2013;0 after heading in a free kick by Schweinsteiger. Portugal responded with a goal right before halftime, but Germany reclaimed their two-goal lead in the second half when Schweinsteiger assisted another header, this time by Michael Ballack. Germany saw out the rest of the match comfortably, conceding a late consolation goal, leaving the final score at 3&#x2013;2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2008/7363493.stm |title=Portugal 2&#x2013;3 Germany |date=19 June 2008 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012 |first=Andrew |last=McKenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    Germany went into their semifinal match against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] as the favourites. However, the team put up a nervous and shaky performance, falling behind due to [[U&#x11F;ur Boral]]'s goal in the 22nd minute. [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] equalised, and [[Miroslav Klose]] put Germany ahead with less than twelve minutes left only for [[Semih &#x15E;ent&#xFC;rk]] to level the score in the last minutes of the match. Just as the game was heading for extra time, defender [[Philipp Lahm]] cut inside past [[Colin Kazim-Richards]], exchanged passes with [[Thomas Hitzlsperger]], and stole in at the near post to score in the final minute, sending Germany into the [[UEFA Euro 2008 Final|final]] against [[Spain national football team|Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2008/7363524.stm |title=Germany 3&#x2013;2 Turkey |date=25 June 2008 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=18 February 2012 |first=Phil |last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    Spain were the heavy favourites but Germany was believed to be one of the few sides able to challenge them. Spain controlled the game and took the lead through [[Fernando Torres]]. Germany ended up losing the match 0&#x2013;1, finishing as the runners-up of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2008/7363545.stm |title=Germany 0&#x2013;1 Spain |date=29 June 2008 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 February 2012 |first=Phil |last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

                    Germany does not have a national stadium, so the national team's home matches are rotated among various stadiums around the country. They have played home matches in 39 different cities so far, including venues that were German at the time of the match, such as [[Vienna]], Austria, which staged three games between 1938 and 1942.
                    
                    National team matches have been held most often (42 times) in the stadiums of [[Berlin]], which was the venue of Germany's first home match (in 1908 against [[England national football team|England]]), the current [[Olympiastadion]] provides seats for 74,500 spectators. Other common host cities include [[Hamburg]] (34 matches), [[Stuttgart]] (29), [[Hanover]] (24) and [[Dortmund]]. Another notable location is [[Munich]], which has hosted numerous notable matches throughout the history of German football, including the [[1974 FIFA World Cup Final]], which Germany won against [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]].

                    [[Adidas|Adidas AG]] is the longstanding [[Kit (football)|kit]] provider to the national team, a sponsorship that began in 1954 and is contracted to continue until at least 2018. [[Nike, Inc.]] had been courting the team, and in August 2007 reportedly offered as much as &#x20AC;500&amp;nbsp;million to outfit the team for an eight-year period &#x2013; a figure that is six times what Adidas currently pays &#x2013; but the federation decided to remain with Germany-based Adidas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/08/24/soccer-germany-kit-idUKL2412398020070824 |title = German FA turns down Nike offer, sticks with Adidas |publisher = [[Reuters]] |date = 24 August 2007 |location=London |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    In the 70s, Germany wore [[:de:Erima|Erima]] kits (Erima is a German brand, that currently is a subsidiary of Adidas).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sammlung.sportmuseum.de/fussball/fusball-trikot-deutsche-fusball-nationalmannschaft-1978-1980/ |title= &lt;nowiki&gt;Deutsche Fu&#xDF;ball-Nationalmannschaft 1978&#x2013;1980&lt;/nowiki&gt; |work=sportmuseum.de |publisher=Deutsches Sport &amp; Olympia Museum |date=4 May 2012 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hansanews.de/em2012/deutsche-nationalmannschaft/dfb-trikot-2012/ |title=DFB-Trikot 2012 |work=hansanews.de |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    The national team's home kit has always been a white shirt and black shorts. The colours are derived from [[Flag of Prussia|the 19th century flag]] of the north German State of [[Prussia]]. Since 1988, many of the home kit's designs incorporate details patterned after the German flag. For the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] however, an all-white kit with red and black details will be used which has been a source of controversy amongst some people who claim such kit does not look German enough. The away shirt colour has changed several times. Historically, green shirt with white shorts is the most often used alternative colour combination, derived from the DFB colors (and the ones of a playing field),{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} though it is also reported that the choice is in recognition of the fact that [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]], whose home shirts are green, were the first nation to play Germany in a friendly game after [[World War II]]. Other colours such as grey and black have also been used. A change, from black to red, came in 2005 on the request of [[J&#xFC;rgen Klinsmann]], citing that teams in red are statistically more successful, and perceived as more intimidating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/0,1518,398580,00.html |title=Traditionstrikot vor dem Aus &#x2013; Klinsmann steht auf Rot |language=German |author=J&#xFC;rgen Zelustek, Thomas Niklaus / sid |publisher = [[Spiegel Online]] |date= 1 February 2006 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped to use the red away shirt as first choice for the 2006 World Cup despite less than impressive results when playing in these colors (for example, the 1&#x2013;4 loss in Italy), but Germany played every game at the 2006 World Cup in its home white colours. In 2010, the away colours then changed back to a black shirt and white shorts, but at the tournament the team dressed up in the black shorts from the home kit. The new away kit was worn by the team for the first time in a friendly against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] on 3 March 2010. The German team has since resumed the use of a green shirt on its away kit.

                    Germany has won the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] three times, behind only [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] (five titles) and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (four titles).&lt;ref name="GermanyWC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schwarzundweiss.co.uk/tournaments/fifa-world-cup.html |title=The FIFA World Cup |publisher = schwarzundweiss.co.uk |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has finished as runners-up four times.&lt;ref name="GermanyWC" /&gt; In terms of semifinal appearances, Germany leads with 12, two more than Brazil's 10, which had participated in two more tournaments.&lt;ref name="GermanyWC" /&gt; In the last 15 World Cup tournaments, Germany has always reached at least the stage of the last eight teams.&lt;ref name="GermanyWC" /&gt; Germany has also qualified for every of the 17 World Cups it has entered &#x2013; it did not enter the inaugural competition in Uruguay of [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]] for [[The Great Depression|economic reasons]], and could not qualify for or compete in the post-war [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] as the DFB was reinstated as a FIFA member only two months after this tournament.
                    
                    Germany has also won the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]] three times ([[Spain national football team|Spain]] and [[France national football team|France]] are the only other multiple-time winners with three and two titles respectively), and finished as runners-up three times as well.&lt;ref name="GermanyEC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schwarzundweiss.co.uk/tournaments/uefa-european-championships.html |title=The UEFA European Football Championship |publisher = schwarzundweiss.co.uk |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans have qualified for every European Championship tournament except for the very first European Championship they entered in [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968]].&lt;ref name="GermanyEC" /&gt; For that tournament, Germany was in the only group of three teams and thus only played four qualifying games. The deciding game was a scoreless draw in [[Albania national football team|Albania]] which gave Yugoslavia the edge, having won in their neighbour country.
                    
                    Germany played in the [[Confederations Cup|FIFA Confederations Cup]] twice, in [[1999 FIFA Confederations Cup|1999]] (first round exit) and in [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup|2005]] (third place) as hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schwarzundweiss.co.uk/tournaments/fifa-confed-cup.html |title=The FIFA Confederations Cup |publisher = schwarzundweiss.co.uk |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
