Germany covers an area of {{convert|357,021|km2|sqmi}} and has a largely temperate seasonal climate.

                    Various [[Germanic tribes]] occupied what is now northern Germany and southern Scandinavia since [[classical antiquity]]. A region named [[Germania]] was [[Germania (book)|documented]] by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] before AD&amp;nbsp;100. During the [[Migration Period]] that coincided with the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], the Germanic tribes expanded southward and established kingdoms throughout much of Europe. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Latin name ''Sacrum Imperium'' (Holy Empire) is documented as far back as 1157. The Latin name ''Sacrum Romanum Imperium'' (Holy Roman Empire) was first documented in 1254. The full name "Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation" (''Heiliges R&#xF6;misches Reich Deutscher Nation'') dates back to the 15th century.&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book | last = Zippelius| first = Reinhold| title = Kleine deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte: vom fr&#xFC;hen Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart| trans_title   = Brief German Constitutional History: from the Early Middle Ages to the Present| edition   = 7th| origyear  = 1994| year  = 2006| publisher =Beck| location  = Munich| language  = German| isbn  = 978-3-406-47638-9| page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Occupied during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the rise of [[Pan-Germanism]] inside the [[German Confederation]] resulted in the [[unification of Germany|unification of most of the German states]] in 1871 into the [[German Empire]], which was dominated by [[Prussia]].
                    
                    After the [[German Revolution of 1918&#x2013;1919]] and the subsequent military surrender in [[World War I]], the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary [[Weimar Republic]] in 1918, with some of its territory partitioned in the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Despite its lead in many scientific and cultural fields at this time, Germany nonetheless endured significant economic and political instability, which intensified during the [[Great Depression]] and contributed to [[Machtergreifung|the establishment]] of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] in 1933. The subsequent rise of [[fascism]] led to [[World War II]]. After 1945, Germany was divided by [[Allied-occupied Germany|allied occupation]], and evolved into two states, [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]]. In 1990, the country was [[German reunification|reunified]].
                    
                    Germany has the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP]] and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth-largest by purchasing power parity]]. As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is the [[List of countries by exports|second-largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|third-largest importer]] of goods. It is a [[developed country]] with a [[List of countries by Human Development Index|very high standard of living]], featuring comprehensive [[social security]] that includes the world's oldest [[universal health care]] system. Known for its rich [[Culture of Germany|cultural]] and [[Politics of Germany|political]] [[History of Germany|history]], Germany has been the home of many influential [[German philosophy|philosophers]], [[Music of Germany|music composers]], [[Science and technology in Germany|scientists, and inventors]]. Germany was a founding member of the [[European Communities|European Community]] in 1957, which became the [[European Union|EU]] in 1993. It is part of the [[Schengen Area]], and has been a member of the [[eurozone]] since 1999. Germany is a [[great power]] and is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[G8]], the [[G-20 major economies|G20]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and the [[Council of Europe]].

                    The English word ''Germany'' derives from the Latin [[Germania]], which came into use after [[Julius Caesar]] adopted it for the peoples east of the [[Rhine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schulze |first=Hagen |authorlink=Hagen Schulze |title=Germany: A New History |publisher= Harvard University Press |page=4 |year=1998 |isbn= 0-674-80688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it was the Gauls who first called the people who crossed east of the Rhine ''Germani'' (which the Romans adopted) as the original Germanic tribes did not refer to themselves as ''Germanus'' or ''Germani''. Thus it was only when on Roman soil that this term was employed and the expression generally connoted those peoples who originally hailed east of the Rhine and/or north of the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wolfram |first=Herwig |title= The Roman Empire and its Germanic Peoples |publisher= University of California Press |pages=4&#x2013;5 |year=1997 |isbn= 0-520-08511-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German language|German]] term ''Deutschland'' (originally ''diutisciu land'', "the German lands") is derived from ''[[wikt:deutsch#German|deutsch]]'', descended from [[Old High German]] ''diutisc'' "popular" (i.e. belonging to the ''diot'' or ''diota'' "people"), originally used to distinguish the [[Vernacular|language of the common people]] from [[Latin]] and its [[Romance languages|Romance descendants]].

From southern Scandinavia and north Germany, they expanded south, east and west from the 1st century&amp;nbsp;BC, coming into contact with the [[Celt]]ic tribes of [[Gaul]] as well as [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Balts|Baltic]], and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first =Jill N. |last = Claster |title =Medieval Experience: 300&#x2013;1400 |publisher =New York University Press |year =1982 |page =35 |isbn=0-8147-1381-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Augustus]], Rome began to invade Germania (an area extending roughly from the [[Rhine]] to the [[Ural Mountains]]). In AD&amp;nbsp;9, three [[Roman legion]]s led by [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] were [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|defeated]] by the [[Cheruscan]] leader [[Arminius]]. By AD&amp;nbsp;100, when [[Tacitus]] wrote ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube ([[Limes Germanicus]]), occupying most of the area of modern Germany; Austria, southern [[Bavaria]] and the western [[Rhineland]], however, were Roman provinces.&lt;ref name="9-13"&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 9&#x2013;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now Germany and displaced the smaller Germanic tribes. Large areas (known since the [[Merovingian]] period as [[Austrasia]]) were [[Francia|occupied by the Franks]], and Northern Germany was ruled by the Saxons and Slavs.&lt;ref name="9-13"/&gt;

                    Following the fall of [[Napoleon]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] convened in 1814 and founded the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of [[States of the German Confederation|39 sovereign states]]. Disagreement with [[European Restoration|restoration]] politics partly led to the rise of [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich]]. The ''[[Zollverein]]'', a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henderson |first=W.

The [[Hambach Festival]] in May 1832 was a main event in support of [[German question|German unity]], freedom and democracy. In the light of a [[Revolutions of 1848|series of revolutionary movements in Europe]], which established a republic [[French Revolution of 1848|in France]], intellectuals and commoners started the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]]. King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;
                    
                    Conflict between King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] of Prussia and the increasingly liberal parliament erupted over military reforms in 1862, and the king appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] the new [[Minister President of Prussia]]. Bismarck successfully waged [[Second Schleswig War|war on Denmark]] in 1864. Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 enabled him to create the [[North German Confederation]] (Norddeutscher Bund) and to exclude [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], formerly the leading German state, from the federation's affairs. After the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the German Empire was proclaimed in 1871 in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], uniting all scattered parts of Germany except Austria ({{lang|de|''[[German question|Kleindeutschland]]''}}, or "Lesser Germany").

                    At the beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918&#x2013;19|German Revolution]] in November 1918, Germany was declared a [[republic]]. However, the struggle for power continued, with radical-left [[Communists]] [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|seizing power in Bavaria]]. The revolution came to an end on 11 August 1919, when the democratic [[Weimar Constitution]] was signed by [[President of Germany|President]] [[Friedrich Ebert]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 156&#x2013;160.&lt;/ref&gt; An era of increasing national confidence, a very liberal cultural life and decade of economic prosperity followed - known as the [[Golden Twenties]].
                    Suffering from the [[Great Depression]] of 1929, the harsh peace conditions dictated by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and a long succession of unstable governments, Germans increasingly lacked identification with the government in the early 1930s. This was exacerbated by a widespread right-wing {{lang|de|''Dolchsto&#xDF;legende''}}, or [[stab-in-the-back legend]], which argued that Germany had lost World War I because of those who wanted to overthrow the government. The Weimar government was accused of betraying Germany by signing the Versailles Treaty.
                    
                    By 1932, the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] and the [[Nazi Party]] controlled the majority of [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Parliament]], fuelled by discontent with the Weimar government. After a series of unsuccessful cabinets, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 155&#x2013;158, 172&#x2013;177.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 1933 the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag]] building went up in flames, and a consequent [[Reichstag Fire Decree|emergency decree]] abrogated basic citizens' rights.

                    After the surrender of Germany, the remaining German territory and Berlin were partitioned by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] into four military occupation zones.

They were informally known as "West Germany" and "East Germany". East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose [[Bonn]] as a provisional capital,  to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary ''status quo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wise | first = Michael Z. | title = Capital dilemma: Germany's search for a new architecture of democracy| year = 1998| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | isbn =978-1-56898-134-5 | page = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    West Germany, established as a federal parliamentary republic with a "[[social market economy]]", was allied with the United States, the UK and France. [[Konrad Adenauer]] was elected the first [[Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany|Federal Chancellor]] (''Bundeskanzler'') of Germany in 1949 and remained in office until 1963. Under his and [[Ludwig Erhard]]'s leadership, the country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s, that became famous as the "economic miracle" ({{lang-de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}}). West Germany joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957.
                    
                    East Germany was an [[Eastern Bloc]] state under political and military control by the [[USSR]] via the latter's occupation forces and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Though East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (''[[Politburo|Politb&#xFC;ro]]'') of the communist-controlled [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED), supported by the [[Stasi]], an immense secret service,&lt;ref name="spiegel_20080311"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,540771,00.html|title = New Study Finds More Stasi Spooks|author = maw/dpa|date = 11 March 2008|work = Spiegel Online &#x2013; english site (www.spiegel.de/international)|publisher = [[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate  =30 October 2011|quote = 189,000 people were informers for the Stasi &#x2013; the former Communist secret police &#x2013; when East Germany collapsed in 1989 &#x2013; 15,000 more than previous studies had suggested.

                    While [[Communist propaganda|East German propaganda]] was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.&lt;ref name="NYT_19890822"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/22/world/westward-tide-of-east-germans-is-a-popular-no-confidence-vote.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | title = Westward Tide of East Germans Is a Popular No-Confidence Vote|first = Ferdinand|last = Protzman |date = 22 August 1989|work = www.nytimes.com | publisher = The New York Times | accessdate =30 October 2011 | quote = Behind the mass flight, Western experts say, is widespread and deepening disillusionment with the Honecker leadership's policies, particularly the refusal to consider the type of economic and political changes taking place elsewhere in the [[Eastern Bloc]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Berlin Wall]], built in 1961 to stop East Germans from escaping to West Germany, became a symbol of the [[Cold War]],&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; hence its fall in 1989, following democratic reforms in Poland and Hungary, became a symbol of the [[Fall of Communism]], [[German Reunification]] and ''[[Die Wende]]''.
                    
                    Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the early 1970s by [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]]'s {{lang|de|''[[Ostpolitik]]''}}. In summer 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the [[Iron Curtain]] and open the borders, causing the emigration of thousands of [[East Germans]] to West Germany via Hungary. This had devastating effects on the [[East Germany|GDR]], where regular [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations]] received increasing support. The East German authorities unexpectedly eased the border restrictions, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West; originally intended to help retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the [[Die Wende|''Wende'' reform process]]. This culminated in the ''[[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Treaty]]'' a year later on 12 September 1990, under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]], and Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR ([[New states of Germany|new states]] or "neue L&#xE4;nder").&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;

                    Germany is in [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]], with [[Denmark]] bordering to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] to the south, [[France]] and [[Luxembourg]] to the southwest, and [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes [[47th parallel north|47&#xB0;]] and [[55th parallel north|55&#xB0; N]] (the tip of [[Sylt]] is just north of 55&#xB0;), and longitudes [[5th meridian east|5&#xB0;]] and [[16th meridian east|16&#xB0; E]]. The territory covers {{convert|357021|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, consisting of {{convert|349223|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of land and {{convert|7798|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of water. It is the seventh largest country by area in Europe and the [[List of countries by area|62nd largest in the world]].&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt;
                    
                    Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Alps]] (highest point: the [[Zugspitze]] at {{convert|2962|m|ft|0|disp=or}}) in the south to the shores of the [[North Sea]] (''Nordsee'') in the northwest and the [[Baltic Sea]] (''Ostsee'') in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: [[Wilstermarsch]] at {{convert|3.54|m|ft|1|disp=or}} below sea level) are traversed by such major rivers as the [[Rhine]], [[Danube]] and [[Elbe]].  Glaciers are found in the Alpine region, but are experiencing deglaciation. Significant natural resources are iron ore, coal, [[potash]], timber, [[lignite]], [[uranium]], copper, natural gas, salt, nickel, [[arable land]] and water.&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html| title = World Factbook | accessdate =26 March 2011|publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    ===Climate===

                    Most of Germany has a [[temperate|temperate seasonal climate]] in which humid westerly winds predominate. The country is situated in between the [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] Western European and the [[Continental climate|continental]] Eastern European climate. The climate is moderated by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], the northern extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]. This warmer water affects the areas bordering the North Sea; consequently in the northwest and the north the climate is [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. Germany gets an average of {{convert|789|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] per year. Rainfall occurs year-round, with no obligatory dry season. Winters are mild and summers tend to be warm, temperatures can exceed {{convert|30|&#xB0;C|&#xB0;F|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name="climate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate in Germany|url=http://www.germanculture.com.ua/library/facts/bl_climate.htm|publisher=GermanCulture|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    The east has a more [[continental climate]]; winters can be very cold and summers very warm, and longer dry periods can occur. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate over most of the country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, some areas of the Central German Uplands have a mountain climate, characterised by lower temperatures and greater precipitation.&lt;ref name="climate"/&gt;

                    Plants and animals are those generally common to middle Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute one-third of the forests; conifers are increasing as a result of reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include deer, wild boar, mouflon, fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of beavers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bekker |first=Henk |title=Adventure Guide Germany |year=2005 |publisher=Hunter |isbn =978-1-58843-503-3 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prussian blue|blue]] [[cornflower]] was once a German [[floral emblem|national symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Marcel Cleene|author2=Marie Claire Lejeune| title = Compendium of Symbolic and Ritual Plants in Europe: Herbs| url = http://books.google.com/?id=g5GBAAAAMAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = Man &amp; Culture| quote=The Cornflower was once the floral emblem of Germany (hence the German common name Kaiserblume).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'' (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/index.html|title=Federal Constitutional Court|publisher=Bundesverfassungsgericht|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's supreme court system, called ''Oberste Gerichtsh&#xF6;fe des Bundes'', is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]] [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]], and for other affairs the courts are the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany|Federal Labour Court]], the [[Bundessozialgericht|Federal Social Court]], the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany|Federal Finance Court]] and the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany|Federal Administrative Court]].  The ''[[V&#xF6;lkerstrafgesetzbuch]]'' regulates the consequences of [[crimes against humanity]], [[genocide]] and [[war crimes]], and gives German courts [[universal jurisdiction]] in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/vstgb/BJNR225410002.html#BJNR225410002BJNG000200000|title=V&#xF6;lkerstrafgesetz Teil 1 Allgemeine Regelungen|publisher=Bundesministerium der Justiz|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the ''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]'' and the ''[[B&#xFC;rgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'' respectively. The German penal system is aimed towards rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stvollzg/__2.html|title=&#xA7; 2 Strafvollzugsgesetz|publisher=Bundesministerium der Justiz|accessdate=26 March 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for petty crimes, which are tried before a single professional judge, and serious [[political crime]]s, all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which [[lay judge]]s (''{{lang|de|[[Sch&#xF6;ffe]]n}}'') sit side by side with professional judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Criminal Justice in Germany | first= J&#xF6;rg-Martin | last= Jehle | author2= [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|German Federal Ministry of Justice]] | publisher= Forum-Verlag | year= 2009 | page= 23 | isbn= 978-3-936999-51-8 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=-V-ng-8jOoQC&amp;pg=PA23 | ref= {{harvid|Jehle|BMJ|2009}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Lay Judges in the German Criminal Courts | page=141 | first1 = Gerhard | last1= Casper | authorlink1= Gerhard Casper | first2= Hans | last2= Zeisel | authorlink2= :de:Hans Zeisel | journal= [[Journal of Legal Studies]] | volume= 1 | issue= 1 | date= January 1972 | jstor= 724014 | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    Many of the fundamental matters of [[administrative law]] remain in the jurisdiction of the states, though most states base their own laws in that area on the 1976 ''Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz'' (Administrative Proceedings Act) covering important points of administrative law. The ''Oberverwaltungsgerichte'' are the highest level of administrative jurisdiction concerning the state administrations, unless the question of law concerns federal law or state law identical to federal law. In such cases, final appeal to the Federal Administrative Court is possible.

                    Germany's military, the ''Bundeswehr'', is organised into ''[[German Army|Heer]]'' (Army), ''[[German Navy|Marine]]'' (Navy), ''[[German Air Force|Luftwaffe]]'' (Air Force), ''[[Bundeswehr Joint Medical Service]]'' and ''[[Streitkr&#xE4;ftebasis]]'' (Joint Support Service) branches. The role of the ''Bundeswehr'' is described in the [[Constitution of Germany]] (Art. 87a) as absolutely defensive only. Its only active role before 1990 was the ''Katastropheneinsatz'' (disaster control). Within the ''Bundeswehr'', it helped after natural disasters both in Germany and abroad. After 1990, the international situation changed from East-West confrontation to one of general uncertainty and instability. Today, after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994 the term "defense" has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the [[security]] of Germany anywhere in the world.

Since the 1960s, a reform movement attempted to unify secondary education in a ''Gesamtschule'' ([[comprehensive school]]); several West German states later simplified their school system to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called ''Duale Ausbildung'' ("[[Dual education system|dual education]]") allows pupils in [[vocational training]] to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.&lt;ref name="ED"/&gt; This successful model is highly regarded and reproduced all around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4f43b5c4-a32b-11e1-8f34-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2RApE4hJA A German model goes global] - Dual education following the German role model is replicated around the world (Financial Times)&lt;/ref&gt;

                    Numerous German painters have enjoyed international prestige through their work in diverse artistic styles. [[Albrecht D&#xFC;rer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Matthias Gr&#xFC;newald]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] were important artists of the [[Renaissance]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]] of [[Baroque]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[Carl Spitzweg]] of [[Romanticism]], [[Max Liebermann]] of [[Impressionism]] and [[Max Ernst]] of [[Surrealism]].
                    
                    Several German artist groups formed in the 20th century, such as the [[November Group (German)|November Group]] or [[Die Br&#xFC;cke]] (The Bridge) and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider) in [[Expressionism]]. The [[New Objectivity]] arose as a counter-style to it during the [[Weimar Republic]]. After [[World War 2|WWII]], main movements of [[Neo-expressionism]], [[performance art]] and [[Conceptual art]] evolved, with notable artists such as [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[J&#xF6;rg Immendorff]], [[HA Schult]], [[Aris Kalaizis]], [[Neo Rauch]] ([[New Leipzig School]]) and [[Andreas Gursky]] (photography). Major art exhibitions and festivals in Germany are the [[documenta]], [[transmediale]] and [[Art Cologne]].

                    Architectural contributions from Germany include the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian styles]], which were precursors of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]. [[Brick Gothic]] in medieval times and [[Brick Expressionism]] in modern times are two distinctive styles that developed in Germany. Also in [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. [[Weser Renaissance]] and ''[[Dresden]] Baroque''). Among many renowned Baroque masters were [[Matth&#xE4;us Daniel P&#xF6;ppelmann|P&#xF6;ppelmann]], [[Johann Balthasar Neumann|Balthasar Neumann]], [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff|Knobelsdorff]] and the [[Asam brothers]].
                    
                    Germany is especially renowned for its [[Timber framing|timber frame]] [[Altstadt|old towns]], with many well-kept examples to be found along the [[German Timber-Frame Road]], leading from the very [[Southern Germany|south of Germany]] to [[Northern Germany]] and its coasts.
                    
                    [[File:Kurhaus in Binz.jpg|thumb|Kurhaus [[Binz]] on [[R&#xFC;gen|Rugia Island]], a typical example of [[resort architecture]]. This style is common on the German [[Baltic Sea]] coast.]]
                    When industrialisation spread across Europe, [[Classicism]] and a distinctive style of [[Historicism (art)|historism]] developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as ''[[Gr&#xFC;nderzeit]] style'', due to the economical boom years at the end of the 19th century. [[Resort architecture]] and [[Spa architecture]] are sub-styles, that evolved since the 18th century in Germany, with the first modern [[List of spa towns in Germany|Spa]]s and [[List of seaside resorts in Germany|Seaside resort]]s of Europe. Many architects formed this era, with [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel|Schinkel]], [[Gottfried Semper|Semper]], [[Friedrich August St&#xFC;ler|St&#xFC;ler]], [[Friedrich von G&#xE4;rtner|von G&#xE4;rtner]], [[Franz Heinrich Schwechten|Schwechten]] and [[Constantin Lipsius|Lipsius]] among them.
                    
                    [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] became a dominant architectural style at the turn of the 19th to the 20th century, with a strong influence of the Art Nouveau movement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm |title=Art Nouveau - Art Nouveau Art |publisher=Huntfor.com |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Art Deco]] movement did not gain much influence in Germany, instead the [[Expressionist architecture]] spread across the country, with e.g. [[Johann Friedrich H&#xF6;ger|H&#xF6;ger]], [[Erich Mendelsohn|Mendelsohn]], [[Dominikus B&#xF6;hm|B&#xF6;hm]] and [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Schumacher]] being influential architects.
                    
                    Germany was particularly important in the early [[modern architecture|modern movement]] - it is the home of the [[Bauhaus]] movement founded by [[Walter Gropius]]. And thus Germany is a cradle of [[modern architecture]]. [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century. He conceived of the glass fa&#xE7;ade skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2006|title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=880|isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
                    Renowned contemporary architects and offices include [[Hans Kollhoff]], [[Helmut Jahn]], [[Graft architects|Graft]], [[Behnisch Architekten|Behnisch]], [[Albert Speer, Jr.|Albert Speer Junior]], [[Frei Otto]], [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners|GMP]], [[Auer+Weber+Assoziierte|AWA]], [[Ingenhoven Architects|Ingenhoven]], [[Sauerbruch Hutton]], [[Sergei Enwerowitsch Tschoban|Sergei Tchoban]], [[Hadi Teherani]], [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]], [[Gottfried B&#xF6;hm]], [[Stephan Braunfels]] and [[Anna Heringer]].

                    [[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Brothers Grimm]]]]
                    German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. Well-known German authors include [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] and [[Theodor Fontane]]. The collections of folk tales published by the [[Brothers Grimm]] popularised [[German folklore]] on an international level. Influential authors of the 20th century include [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Heinrich B&#xF6;ll]] and [[G&#xFC;nter Grass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/articles/espmark/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=3 December 1999 |author=[[Kjell Espmark|Espmark, Kjell]] |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; German-speaking book publishers produce some 700&amp;nbsp;million books every year, with about 80,000 titles, nearly 60,000 of them new.

                    German philosophy is historically significant. [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s contributions to [[rationalism]]; the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] philosophy by [[Immanuel Kant]]; the establishment of classical [[German idealism]] by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]; [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of [[communist theory]] by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s development of [[perspectivism]]; [[Gottlob Frege]]'s contributions to the dawn of [[analytic philosophy]]; [[Martin Heidegger]]'s works on Being; and the development of the [[Frankfurt school]] by [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[J&#xFC;rgen Habermas]] have been particularly influential. In the 21st century, Germany has contributed to the development of contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Searle, John|year=1987|title=The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy|chapter=Introduction|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the earlier mention of achievements in science by Germans, it is clear that German literature and philosophy have profoundly shaped Western society's development. Correspondingly, 20th century author Peter Watson, who has written extensively on the progressive development of modern thought, incisively remarks, "Kant, Humboldt, Marx, Clausius, Mendel, Nietzsche, Planck, Freud, Einstein, Weber, Hitler&#x2014;for good or ill, can any other nation boast a collection of eleven (or even more) individuals who compare with these figures in regard to the enduring influence they have had on modern ways of thought?"&lt;ref&gt;Peter Watson, ''The German Genius: Europe's Third Renaissance, the Second Scientific Revolution, and the Twentieth Century'' (New York: Harper Collins, 2011), 828.&lt;/ref&gt;
