Build simplified case that shows the "hanging"-bug
---------------------------------
Stem mentions:
To handle plural etc.
Remove tokens (What if token is the only thing)?
---------------------------------
Copy data to HDFS
---------------------------------
Redirect resolving:
One pass to determine context links and redirects
Join context links with redirects (context link.destination and redirect.source)
Write new context links.
Repeat.
---------------------------------
Determine the following counts for NER:
For each surface:
a) # of documents, in which the mention occurs as a link
b) # of documents, in which the mention does not occur as a link
--> get percentage to use for NER later

Problem is to determine b).
Idea:
For each word in mention:
 - stem
 - join with language model to find out documents
 - intersection

Introduce fake bigrams for the unigram links?

Write tests
